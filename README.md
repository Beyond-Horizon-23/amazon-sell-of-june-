Data collection :
collected data from the Kaggle. Where the format of the file was in CSV format.

Data cleansing :
The data set comprises of the 8 columns previous were asin (unique id of product), Category, rank, rating, no. of sellers, product link, price, review count.
we all know amazon allows us to enter the review to only those who have bought. Signifies for that sure who have entered the review have bought the product .
the columns which were created by me were product sold (product sold= review count ) and money earned ( product sold * price column).

Goal:
To find which category has max product sold with max money earned.
How to improve the sell of the product.
which item accrues max no. of sellers.
which product has maximum sellers.
